# Space Invaders 

## Overview
Welcome to our Space Invaders clone! This game is a simplified version of the classic arcade game where you control a player ship to defend against an alien invasion. The game features a grid of aliens moving side to side and descending towards the player. Your goal is to shoot down all the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen or collide with your ship.

## Game Features

- **Lives Display**: The number of lives you have left is shown on the screen.
- **Alien Grid**: A grid of at least 5 x 10 aliens moves side to side and gradually descends.

- **Pause Feature**: Pressing the 'P' key pauses the game. Press 'P' again to resume.
- **Save State**: You can save your game state to a text file and resume it later.
- **High Scores**: The game maintains a record of the top 5 highest scores, which persist even after closing the game.
